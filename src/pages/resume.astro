                Alongside my role as a Senior Software Engineer, I am also
                responsible for guiding the technical direction of the
                development team, ensuring that the team is working effectively
                and efficiently, and that the software is being developed in a
                way that is maintainable and scalable. I also work closely with
                the Product team to ensure that the software is being developed
                in a way that meets the needs of the business and our customers.

                As part of a small engineering team I design and develop
                solutions to provide a platform for businesses to plan, carry
                out and grow their drone operations. Part of this role also
                involves guiding the design and feel of the software with the
                goal of providing a modern, intuitive user experience.
